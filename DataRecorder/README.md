I forked this as I was searching for info on a MOOC that I completed some years (4-5?) ago and wanted to 
re-examine the java code that accesses the sensors in java ME.

I have experiemnted with pi4j and wireingPi with some success and also with Bluej with great success on earlier versions on both early RPi and RPi 3B+
